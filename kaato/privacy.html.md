# Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Kaato’s iPhone app.

## Information we collect

We collect aggregate, anonymous statistics about app usage and crashes, and which songs and playlist you have listened to.

If you enable push notifications, we need to store the token your device gives us to send them.

We use cookies on the site and similar tokens in the app to keep you logged in.

Like most websites and apps, we also store information through the use of software that may be transparent to users. For example, we may log your IP address and general information about your browser or device.

## Information usage

We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.

We do not share your personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Kaato’s functionality, with the exception of [Fabric](https://fabric.io/), which is embedded in Kaato’s iOS app to provide crash reporting and basic analytics to help us improve the app.

We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such as how many people listen to a particular song with Kaato.

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

## Third-party links and content

Kaato displays links and content from third-party music sites, and downloads song files directly from each provider’s third-party servers. These have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

## Your Consent

By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

## Contacting Us

If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email [privacy@needleapps.com](mailto:privacy@needleapps.com).

## Changes to this policy

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page and update the Privacy Policy modification date below.
