# FAQs

## Do I need internet connection to play the game?

Game uses little amount of internet if you are playing against your friends or other players. **Internet
connection is not required for local games against the computer.**

## Can I request new features?

If you have a feature in mind that would like us to implement or have a feedback about an existing
feature, we are very happy to hear that. You can send these to us at **[feedback@needleapps.com](mailto:feedback@needleapps.com)**.

## Will there be ads in the game?

The game will **eventually** have advertisement to support the ongoing development but for time being,
there are no ads. We want to perfect the game play and make sure you are enjoying the game before we
can think about monetizing the game and paving the way for long term sustainability.

## I don't want to see the ads

Once we do implement the ads in the game, you will have an option to get rid of them for a small price.
Once again, this is not yet implemented and is not going to be done in the immediate future as our
focus is on the gameplay and getting the rest of the app to be a fun app.

## I like the game, how can I support you?

Great! For now, you can support us by sharing the game among your friends and giving us important
feedback on what would you like to see improved. You can leave a review for us on the AppStore.

Once the game has advertisements, you can support our efforts by buying the in-app purchase to remove the advertisement.
