## Internet usage

App caches the music files aggreesively until the local limit _(2GB for free version and unlimited for Full version)_ is reached.
Once a song has been played, it will be cached locally and not network would be used anymore.

## I don't want to see the ads

Thats great! You can buy the full version by clicking 'Buy Full Verison' button in the sidebar menu.

## What are the benefits of Full version?

* **No Ads**.
* **Unlimited local storage** instead of 2GB for free version.
* **Unlimited playlists** instead of 3 playlists for free version.

## Purchased the app and reinstalled. How do I remove the ads again?

You can restore your purchase by clicking 'Buy Full Version' button in the sidebar menu.

## App is crashing randomly.

This can happen if the app data has been corrupted. This should __not__ happen in normal circumstances but if it does, please delete the app and reinstall it from App store.
